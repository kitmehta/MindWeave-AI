**An open-source, dual-portal (instructor + student) agentic platform that closes the curriculum loop — generate evidence-based course content, track real learner behavior via xAPI, and continuously optimize modules through AI agents with human-in-the-loop control.**

> **Generate** — A Tavily research agent queries academic, video, and news sources before any content is written. Bloom's Taxonomy alignment, Krashen's i+1 difficulty progression, and Cognitive Load Theory are built into the generation pipeline, so the curriculum structure is grounded in how learning actually works. No hallucinated citations.

> **Track** — Every student interaction produces xAPI statements. A 5-node A2A multi-agent pipeline (BehaviorAnalyst · RiskDetector · ContentOptimizer · CohortComparator) analyzes engagement patterns, flags at-risk learners, and surfaces underperforming modules — with a full analytics dashboard and exportable reports.

> **Optimize** — The Curriculum Agent translates analytics findings into targeted module edits. Instructors review each suggestion with a before/after preview and approve or reject changes individually. Approved edits feed back into the next xAPI data cycle — the loop closes.

> **Personalize** — Students build learning profiles with discipline preferences, multi-character persona sets with relationship-mapped narrative anchors, and custom AI instructions. A configurable Agent Team (18 preset models + custom model support across 9 providers) lets users choose their own LLM stack. A template-driven diagnosis engine provides gentle, one-sentence concept-gap guidance — no scores, no rankings, just a map of where to look next.

## 🧭 Design Philosophy

Most EdTech AI tools treat artificial intelligence as a threat to be monitored — detecting whether students used AI, flagging "inauthentic" work, enforcing originality.

Plot Ark takes the opposite position.

**AI is a cognitive tool, not a threat.** A student who uses AI to draft an answer, then understands it, refines it, and can explain it in their own words — that student has learned. Copy-paste without comprehension is a student deceiving themselves, not a system to be policed.

Plot Ark has no AI detection mechanism. It never will. The question it asks is not *"did you use AI?"* but *"did learning happen?"* — and it answers that through Bloom's Taxonomy alignment, i+1 difficulty progression, and xAPI learner behavior tracking.

The curriculum engine itself is built the same way: AI generates the structure, pedagogy constrains the output, and the instructor stays in the loop. The tool thinks; the human decides.

This system was built so that no one gets left behind by the system. The author was one of those people who were ignored by the system.

Anthropic's Economic Index (Jan 2026) found r = 0.925 between prompt sophistication and response sophistication — the deeper you engage it, the deeper it responds.

<details>
<summary><strong>🤖 A2A Multi-Agent Analytics</strong></summary>

- **5-node pipeline** — `Orchestrator → [BehaviorAnalyst ‖ RiskDetector ‖ ContentOptimizer ‖ CohortComparator] → aggregate → LTM snapshot`. All agents are currently sql-only (Phase 2 = LLM integration pending).
- **PII anonymisation** — student names/emails are anonymised before agent processing; real identities are restored only in the final aggregated report for the professor.
- **xAPI mock data engine** — 4 noise levels (5%/10%/15%/20%) seeded from frontend UI; realistic 6-week timestamp distribution with `HOUR_WEIGHTS` and profile-based student spread (high_performer / average / struggling / disengaged). **Curriculum-aware**: queries `change_log` for applied modules and uses `IMPROVED_VERB_DIST` to simulate realistic post-optimization improvement.
- **Hive-style node architecture** — each agent inherits `BaseNode` with reflexion/retry (max 3), L3 JSON Schema validation, and SQL fallback
- **SharedMemory (Redis)** — agents communicate through Redis-backed shared memory (`a2a:{session_id}:{key}`) with local dict fallback
- **Token usage tracking** — `NodeResult` carries `tokens_in / tokens_out / tokens_cache_read / tokens_cache_write`. Orchestrator prints a token summary table to backend log after each run; report JSON includes a `token_summary` block. Frontend sidebar shows a Token Usage panel (currently all zero — sql-only Phase 1).
- **LTM 3-layer architecture** — Hot (Redis, pipeline runtime), Warm (PostgreSQL `course_analysis_snapshots`, persisted per-run), Cold (`data/ltm/*.md` YAML+Markdown, versioned with course codes)
- **Historical trend visualization** — `TrendChart.tsx` (pure SVG) shows at-risk % and completion rate over time; mini mode + full-screen modal with date labels, larger data points, and summary stat cards
- **SSE real-time streaming** — analysis progress streams via Server-Sent Events; frontend shows live agent status
- **Student Data dashboard** — dedicated full-page analytics view with resizable sidebar, section navigation, noise-level selector, and Token Usage panel
- **Risk detection** — 6 signals; thresholds: medium ≥ 4, high ≥ 7; inactivity windows: 14 / 21 days
- **Cohort comparison** — students grouped into high_performers / average / at_risk / disengaged with avg completion and struggle rates
- **6-section report export** — PDF (Anthropic-style cover), DOCX, Excel. Sections: Behavior Analysis, Risk Assessment, Content Optimization, Cohort Comparison, **Analysis History** (table + matplotlib trend chart), Overview & Recommended Actions. Filenames include course slug + noise label.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Curriculum Agent — Agentic Curriculum Optimization</strong></summary>

- **Three-layer HITL design** — suggestions are classified into three action tiers based on signal severity and change scope:
  - **Layer 1 — Objectives (AI applies directly)**: amber badge; one-click Apply writes updated learning objectives + reduces complexity_level; before/after confirmation modal; Redo restores original
  - **Layer 2 — References (human-triggered search)**: violet badge; "Search References" button fires a Tavily query against module objectives, returns deduplicated candidates (domain-level dedup vs existing readings); professor selects and adds references directly to `recommended_readings`
  - **Layer 3 — Assignments (AI alert only)**: blue badge; read-only info box summarizing what changed and what the professor should manually review; no Apply button — professor decides
- **Professor Notification Bar** — persistent amber bar on CoursePage alerts professors when suggestions are available, with "Dismiss" and "Review →" buttons
- **Professor Slide-out Drawer** — clicking "Review" opens a 400px drawer with Pending Suggestions (Apply/Search) and Applied Changes (Redo) sections grouped by layer badge
- **Student Notification Bar** — blue bar shows "N modules updated — based on instructor optimization" with Dismiss and Review buttons
- **Student Slide-out Drawer** — clicking "Review" opens a blue-themed drawer listing updated modules with "Go to Module" navigation buttons
- **Draggable Floating Action Button (FAB)** — after dismissing either banner, a draggable floating ball (🤖 amber / ✨ blue) appears at bottom-right; click opens the drawer directly without restoring the banner; hover reveals ✕ to permanently dismiss; supports free-drag to any screen position
- **Auto-analyze on generation** — every new course triggers a background structural analysis immediately after save; generates all three change_type entries so suggestions are ready without waiting for an xAPI run
- **Redo (Undo Apply)** — applied changes store original module data as backup; clicking "Redo" restores the module to its pre-apply state and moves the suggestion back to Pending
- **Module Flags** — `module_flags` table stores flagged modules with signal sources, flag levels (yellow / orange), and detailed metrics
- **Change Log** — `change_log` table records all recommendations with `change_type` (objective_update / reference_suggestion / assignment_alert), status tracking (pending → applied → dismissed), and backup_data for redo
- **Analytics redirect** — "View Full Analytics →" in the professor drawer navigates to the Student Data analytics page

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📦 Export Formats</strong></summary>

- **IMS Common Cartridge (.imscc)** for LMS integration (Canvas, Moodle, D2L).
- **PDF, DOCX, and Markdown** with dynamically formatted citations (APA/MLA/Chicago).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **Frontend** | React + TypeScript + Vite | Module editor, A2A dashboard, SSE client, drag-and-drop |
| **Backend** | Python + Flask Blueprints | Modular route-based API (10 Blueprints + 6 Agents + 6 Services) |
| **AI** | OpenAI GPT-4o / Google Gemini | Content generation & A2A analysis (via `AI_PROVIDER`); A2A agents are sql-only — **zero LLM cost** for analytics |
| **Research Agent** | Tavily Search API | Pre-generation academic source retrieval |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | Curricula, xAPI statements, student feedback, `course_analysis_snapshots` (LTM) |
| **Cache & Memory**| Redis | Graph query cache, learner state, A2A shared memory (`a2a:{session}:{key}`) |
| **Knowledge Graph**| LightRAG + networkx + react-force-graph-2d| Course material ingestion → interactive concept graph |
| **Behavior Data** | xAPI 1.0.3 + mini-LRS | Statement ingestion → mock data engine (4 noise levels) → professor analytics panel |
| **Analytics Engine**| A2A multi-agent (Hive-style, sql-only Phase 1) | 5-node pipeline: Orchestrator + 4 parallel agents; token tracking; LTM snapshot |
| **Report Export** | ReportLab + python-docx + openpyxl + matplotlib | PDF (Anthropic-style cover), DOCX, Excel; filenames include course slug + noise label |
| **Curriculum Export** | IMS Common Cartridge + DOCX + PDF + Markdown | LMS-compatible output in multiple formats |
| **Dev** | Docker Compose | Single-command local environment (frontend :5173, backend :5000) |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Docker, an OpenAI or Gemini API key, a Tavily API key (free tier at tavily.com)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Schlaflied/Plot-Ark
cd Plot-Ark

cp .env.example .env
# Set AI_PROVIDER=openai or AI_PROVIDER=gemini
# Add the corresponding API key + TAVILY_API_KEY

docker compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost:5173 |
| Backend | http://localhost:5000 |

## 🕸️ Using the Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph feature lets you ingest your own course materials (PDFs, PPTXs, or DOCXs) and explore them as an interactive concept map.

1. Go to the **Knowledge Graph** tab
2. In the **Upload Materials** panel on the right, fill in:
   - **Subject name** (required) — e.g. "Organizational Behavior"
   - **Course code** (optional) — e.g. "ADMS 2400"
   - **Year** (required) — which year of study this course belongs to
3. Drop your PDF / PPTX / DOCX files into the dropzone
4. Click **Build Graph** — ingestion runs in the background (~$0.10–0.30 per 10 PDFs at llama-3.3-70b-versatile rates)
5. Once complete, the graph appears automatically under the correct year and course tab

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] KG ↔ Curriculum concept mapping — 3-layer matching (word-boundary + abbreviation + reverse lookup)
- [x] Knowledge Map tab — per-module KG concepts with definitions + cross-module dependencies
- [x] Concept mastery tracking — xAPI verb + feedback → `cohort_concept_mastery`; auto-sync after every analysis run
- [x] GraphViewer mastery overlay — fill = mastery level, border = knowledge layer; unified gray for untracked concepts
- [x] KG bidirectional annotation — students mark confused/important; professors mark exam focus; anonymous aggregation feeds confusion heatmap
- [x] KG → Agentic Loop — `KGContextAnalystNode` injects per-concept confusion % + top confused concepts into CurriculumAgent context
- [x] GraphViewer role-split — student view (mastery filters + confusion social signal) vs professor view (high confusion heatmap + exam focus)
- [x] xAPI ↔ KG bridge — KG annotation events mirror to xAPI statements (verb: flagged / noted); full signal unification
- [x] Student Profile — 4-tab profile with avatar, discipline selector (5 disciplines), CP/OC narrative anchors, and progress color blocks
- [x] One-sentence diagnosis — template-driven concept-gap guidance with "Jump to Module" navigation
- [x] AI Settings — custom prompt instructions + clickable ideas library with auto-save
- [x] Multi-persona sets — multiple character groups with relationship tags, gender, personality descriptions, linked courses
- [x] Multi-model Agent Team — 18 preset models across 9 providers + custom model support; ★ recommended tags, ⚠ MoE warnings, dynamic API keys
- [x] Professor Settings Portal — profile, academic preferences, model defaults, prompt templates; all with auto-save
- [x] Per-provider API keys — Fernet-encrypted storage, dynamic detection, masked GET responses
- [ ] Professor prompt template editor — DB-backed prompt management with version control and variable highlighting
- [ ] Assignment Timeline + Due Date calculator
- [ ] A2A Phase 2 — LLM integration for CurriculumAgent (dense model required); other agents remain sql-only
- [ ] Progressive summarization — semester-level LTM summaries for LLM context management
- [ ] LTI 1.3 — push into Canvas / Moodle

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

Architectural inspiration from [Hive](https://github.com/aden-hive/hive) (YC-backed AI agent infrastructure) — the node pipeline, shared memory, and evolution loop patterns informed the agentic curriculum engine design.

Knowledge graph layer powered by [LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) (HKUDS) — incremental knowledge graph construction and prerequisite inference across course materials.

Two-phase generation pipeline design inspired by [OpenMAIC](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC) (Tsinghua University) — the outline-first, then expand pattern informed Plot Ark's curriculum skeleton generation approach.

Built with [Claude](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic) as AI pair programmer.

Special thanks to the two chief quality assurance officers who supervised every late-night coding session — **Icy** (冰糖, white) and **雪梨** (calico):
